A few programs illustrating the use of the IO package.

Applications:
 + primeNumbers - takes first 10 prime numbers, write them into a file, then reads from the file
 + randomNumbers - asks for the range of random numbers (start and finish), then writes them into a file and reads the file
 + readGif - reads bytes from a file "gifIn.gif" and prints them on the screen, makes a copy of that file
 + alphabet - writes the alphabet into a file
 + longText - reads a long text from a file
